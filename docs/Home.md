**Project Description**
linq2indexeddb makes it easier for JavaScript developpers to make use of the client side database: IndexedDB.

With linq2indexeddb developpers can add, update, delete and search data on an easy way without having to think how to put up an connection, handeling transaction, etc. For now this project is still in development, so everything is subject to change.

Now only the basic CRUD operations are supported. In the near future this will be extended to multiple where clauses, joins, ...

This framework is also available on nuget! [ http://nuget.org/packages?q=linq2indexeddb]( http://nuget.org/packages?q=linq2indexeddb) and a working sample of the framework can be found on [ http://linq2Indexeddb.kristofdegrave.be]( http://linq2Indexeddb.kristofdegrave.be)

You can also run the unit tests of the framework on the following url: [http://linq2indexeddb.kristofdegrave.be/test/](http://linq2indexeddb.kristofdegrave.be/test/). These tests are still under construction and will increase in number in the near future.

To ensure that the framework works on multiple browsers/platforms, browserstack ([ http://www.browserstack.com]( http://www.browserstack.com)) will be used to test all possibilities.

**Update**: The new version of the linq2indexedDB library is now available for download.
